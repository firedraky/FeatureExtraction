@KatyComeTrue  The word "festooned" is woefully underused. #tweetdebate

@current  Hmmm...I just noticed you guys have other topic things at the top.  What do those do?  #current
would two fourths of July equal a half a July? #current #tweetdebate

1pt for McCain on another 9/11 attack..."we are a safe nation but far from safe". #tweetdebate

@sarking White privilege. He's a scolding grandfather, Obama interrupting looks like an "angry black man." #debate08
#tweetdebate McCain rude and condescending -5 Obama magnanimous and confident +5
Is McCain a truther??? #tweetdebate
@cgritter Then if obama says "he's right" that's another shot (or "he may be right") #debate08.
did rudy giuliani slip Jim some $ to ask the 9/11 question?!?! #current, #debate08, #tweetdebate
Retweet @CollinKelley: McCain created the 911 commission? I guess he did that right after he created the Blackberry #current #tweetdebate

Anyone keeping track of how many times McCain invokes 9/11? #tweetdebate
laptop battery empty :-( #tweetdebate
It's REALLY starting to bother me that McCain won't even glance at Obama. It shows a lack of respect. #current
McCain wants to work with our allies, but won't meet with Spain #current
Rove...I mean McCain has studied his points very well. Too bad they just seem void of any substance to anyone LISTENING. #current
Can Obama protect America if his teleprompter breaks? #current #debate08
The biggest threat to the United States is Obama as President #current
"declare america safe?" will that come with some kind of money back guarantee? #current
#current Obama is really getting angry at the moderator when he interrupts... you sure he took enough of those meds today?
We don't need to keep hyping this FAKE WAR on TERROR!!   Keep us SECURE, Obama... we don't need our LIBERTY.  #current
"How many times is Obama going to have to say "That's not true, John"." ahmen @hack26 #current
Isn't it past McCains bedtime? Maybe that's why he keeps telling these "bedtime" stories #current
No John, off-shore drilling isn't a bridge. It would take 20 years to see any effect of new off-shore drilling. #current
McCain winning? WTF? He hasn't said anything. #debate08 #current
WTF.... Obama believes in missile defense??? Since when! #debate08 #current
#current #tweetdebate Mc's dismissiveness makes him look stronger to the bully class.
#debate08 #current 9/11 question is a big softball for Obama to whine about Iraq some more.
Is Obama stuttering now???#current
We poured that money into airport security, and yet you're able to get around that by changing your name. *sigh* #current #debate08
Can you ever really claim America safe?  That's the problem with waging a war with no clear definition of victory. #current #debate08
OMG Lets kill something else for oil now.. sheess #current Penguins and Caribou dont know how to shoot..
Obama has to tell McCain that's not true John to wake him up he is sleeping during the debate, at least his answers sound like it #current

But what about the Change? #current
No, no, no - the biggest threat is lettig McCain leave with smirk on his face  #current
Safer today? Go abroad as an American, McCain & get reality check.  #current
I don't want to hear about offshore drilling at all, anymore, ever. Talk about alternatives, McCain, or you're not talking to me.   #current

#debate08 #current  Obama  We need missile defense,  Another GOP theme.
Personally, I just think Obama is more level-headed and I would feel safer with him than McC. McC maverickism scares me #current
McCain definitely got his rear end handed to him tonight. Obama was simply on point in this debate. #current
I wish either candidate would talk about what a joke airport security is. #current

#2019 #current i wish i could tell him there's never been a suticase nuclear attack anywhere.  i don't think any individual is bold enough.
Independents represent 42% of the voting population -- yet we are NOT REPRESENTED at this #tweetdebate. Shameful.
McCain sounds like a war monger filled with fear.  #current
Just how is this country the "greatest?" #debate08 #current
#current I hope the next debate is more exciting and less polite.
Has mccain looked @ obama at all this whole debate? #current
you think if people stop talking about "terrorism" it would just go away?  you know, out of sight out of mind. #current
Obama: "We are less respected now."  Well, you're less respected by me if you keep this play-it-safe mode up.  #current
#debate08 #current  Does Obama actually think we aren't trying to go after all Qaeda?
@Edge32 I agree... Obama is being far too accommodating of McCain's tone & interruptions #current #debate08
Obama's tie is crooked!!! #current
#current @sull @gnimsh there's no need for a 9/11 style attack on the US anymore. We're destroying ourselves without any outsidel help.

We are less respected now... Obama #current #debate08   And I give credit to McCain... NOOOO
Amen Obama. We are less respected. #current
the way we're perceived in the world...put ya weight on it Barack! #debate08 #current
Less respected than four years ago - a major understatement! We don't even respect ourselves anymore! #current
Yes, reps are experts on torture. #debate08 #current
#current Obama - we need to go to Afghanistan and Pakistan...and he wants more troops...is he really a democrat?!
We are definitely less respected now in the eyes of the rest of the world. This celebrity election is not helping. #current
damn right we're not respected anymore. we need a president who's gonna restore our international credibility. #current
Obama keeps saying him & McCain r not different. I thought O said McCain is 3rd Bush term. If true, is O going 2 b a 3rd term 2? #current
Mcain, working with Lieberman does not make you bipartisan. He is not really a democrat. #tweetdebate
McCain VS Obama in a cage match. GO!#current
quick! McCain! Get in another Slogan! #current
#current Obama is really getting angry at the moderator when he interrupts...
O: Restore how we're perceived in the world - we're less respected now than we were 8 years ago, even 4 years ago #debates08, #current
I agree w/ @movingsideways....this has been difficult to watch. Not atl all what I expected. #current
Obama goes into apologizing for the USA again, what a scumbag he is #current
Half way through telling you the real reasons why Obama should be president I realized you you wanted to keep kidding yourself. #current
honestly mccain really stressed me out... he was being SO mean. I don't like it when people are that mean in something so important #current
@Condoulo how doesnt he respect the Nat'l Anthem - why does it matter so much if he respects the country, #tweetdebate

restoring America's standing in the world, is indeed important #debate08 #current
#current I agree that most people will remain unchanged by debate. Usually the case. Never know, though. Could be different later
@current  Yes, I don't like feeling not respected because of the actions of others.  People are funny that way.  #current

again "Senator Obama still doesn't understand.." ugh. #current
The safer question is a joke. We are chasing our tails, after something happens. What is thought determines how the USA is treated #current
#current McPain: Reagan's SDI was major factor of ending cold war. Obama doesn't get that failing in Iraq will embolden enemy.

Iraq is lost give it up Mc Cain! #current
-1pt for McCain's attack. How can we fail in Iraq? We don't even know how to win there! #tweetdebate
If the terrorists think an attack will help McCain win, they will attack before the election. #current

#current Stop saying 'cold war' and 'holocaust' McCain, you just sound desperate and stupid.
@gesteves Right, ignoring them just gives them more room #current

Okay-we all know Obama wants us out of Iraq, say something new #current
How can you people think there is a difference between these two... Sounds like all the same BS to me. #current
Obama should be president. McCain should retire and collect social security. #current
#debate08 #current #tweetdebate McCain's talking point: Obama doesn't get it.  He's doing a good job of driving that message home.
mccain -1 when asked about our standing in the world goes back to missile defense and rides Reagan's coattails #tweetdebate

Both McCain and Obama are a joke! give me 30 min. and I can prove it, lol. (this is to u Current! i luvs my current :)  #current
Is it just me, or is Current being anti-McCain and not showing those comments? #current #debate08
#current all McCain talks about is war ... he is a war lover, a war monger  he would be a president of war
McCain managed to screw up this debate without any help from Palin.Isn't he sad about Bush screwing vets?. #current #tweetdebate #debate08
"when I came home from prison..." Have we heard that one before? #current
#current McPain: when I came home from prison...veterans...heal wounds of war... [that's all you need to know!]
#current #debate08 #tweetdebate wow ... never mentions that PoW issue does he... good thing he was never tortured (* according to US)
wait. MCCAIN JUST ADMITTED TO BEING IN PRISON!!!! What's the crime? are you allowed to be president if you're a felon? WOW. NEWS #current
#current it doesnt matter thay are all going to do what it takes to get there pockets full
McCain's veteran voting record is a disgrace. #current
I think McCain has had 4 strokes throughout this debate.  #tweetdebate
NUUUUUUU sudden death!!! #current
The bracelet/meeting a solder's Mother were low ploys. Talk about what you are doing. Don't use the grieving Mom to make a point #current
MCCain: Vote for me b/c i got fucked up the ass by the viet cong for 5 yrs....#current #debate08
And Sen. Obama finally drops the "my father was from Kenya, that's where I got my name" line. #current
ARRRRRRGGGGGGGHHHHH!!!! McCain is talking about being a POW again. Wow! #current
rt @Tiak McCain, you know veterans, and will take care of them, yet Vet orgs consistently give you low ratings? #current about a minute ago
I'm not trying to be mean here or say their a problem, but why is he constantly talking about verterans and not the public!? #current
Cannot *wait* to see Palin in the VP debates. It's gonna be hi-lar-ious! #current
#current    McCain does remind be a bit of Reagan.  I'm waiting for him to start talking about the Pacific Coast Highway.
Obama ia a liar.#current
Obama won't get any sleep tonight cause he'll be up all night long licking his wounds. Start to prepare for the next one. #current #debate08
THIS WAS POINTLESS. #current
hmm... expected more of Obama #current
I KNEW that McCain couldn't go the entire debate without mentioning being a PoW! #current
Oh, and the US is incapable of diplomacy when it won't back down on any issue #debate08 #current
Veterans, including myself, are continually being mistreated by an Administration you supported 90% of the time Senator McCain #current
Say Whaaat?  MCain fought to keep quiet the investigations of POW's, he didn't try to find them #current
"When I came home from prison" probably wasn't the best choice of words. #current
i knew he'd end with POW talk...sigh;.. #current
McCain clubs baby seals.... seriously. #current #debate08
#current #debate08 #tweetdebate Overall, crappy debate.  Obama needs to learn to punch harder and go direct for JM's throat.
#tweetdebate If Obama can't get his point in with McCain will he be assertive with foreign leaders?
some debate.  they both were duds.  #current #debate08
the moderator sucked. #current
mccain's a douchebag! #current #debate08
Hallelujah! It's over! What do you say we all vote for McCain as Miss Congeniality?!!! #tweetdebate

Phils won.  Mets lost. #current
Finally the prison comes out. #current
only a little time left I need to make it on TV #current
#current: whoa! wait a minute - Clay Aiken is a homosexual??

@lindagoin Not the smoothest transition.
I will never agree with McCain on the war #tweetdebate
#current  McCain never looks at Obama... why is that/
McCain voted against a bill that would cover the total cost of college for vets. He supports them? #current
#current #debate08 Nice choreography of the criss-cross and the wife-hugs.  I hate politcs!
Still wouldn't look at Obama when they shook hands. Ass!  #current #debate08
-5 McCain for saying he will take care of Vets why hasn't he since he has been in Washington forever #tweetdebate
Obama - outdebated... there's no room for gray/corrections in a debate #current
No! McCain was a POW!!! I missed that somehow #current

McCain clubs baby seals.... seriously. #current
regardless of who won the debate tonight...we are the ones who lost #current #debate08
McCain won't even look Obama in they eye when shaking hands. He's so dismissive. What an old bastard. #current
Obama cites father's desire to come to USA-but he didn't stay #current
Is it just me or was this REALLY depresing as far as how #%*$@&'d up the world is right now? Sigh ... #current
Last two points were nothing more than stump speeches by both candidates. #current
#2019 #current when the economy of war didn't stop a recession but caused a depression.  good ol' '08
McCain -1 for overplaying veteran card one or two times too many #tweetdebate
all of that blinking has been shown to be the sign of a fibber, John. #current
Yea, pull out the sob story songbird McCain #current
Obama is a liar. #current
Bottom line: Obama won, but far from decisively.  #current #debate08
The debte ends and Barry calls good job John....indeed #current #debate08
Now I can go to bed in peace #current
YAY!!!!!!!!!!! It's over!!! #current #debate08 #tweetdebate
lucky mccain for getting the last word...the most convincing/presidential thing he has said this debate #current

Jim lehrer wins, indeed. #current
#current #debate08 thanks current! fun stuff!
McCain: "I know how to heal the wounds of war"  Best line of the night. #debate #current
#current jim lehrer is the winner tonight
I like Cindy McCain .. she is on CARE board of directors. #current #tweetdebate #debate08

Obama is wearing a flag lapel and mccain isn't! What will rove say about that? #current
Watching the #current stream, seems like the feelings on who won are a bit mixed, but leaning to Obama's side. Interesting. #debate08
Thank God this shamfuckery is over. Now for the analysis. Where is my man Paul Begala? #debate08 #current
rt @menand McCain doesn't believe that Obama has the experience - but he believes that Palin does? #current #debate08

@kathrynjones he's racist #current
#2019 #current what I wouldn't do to simply have to worry about a war and an economic depression. GEAS makes that look like the war on drugs
Good debate. Obama did well, but it wasn't as one sided as I expected. #current
Go McCain! You rock! #current #debate08
I think I will have fun making a video up with Obama saying John is right and Good Job John LOL #debate08 #current #debateok08
McCain dominated. That's all. #current
OBAMA! #current
Loved the fact that they kept their mics on after the end of the debate... haha #current
Connor from Current for President 20**? not sure when he becomes eligible, lol.  #current
Obama wins. #current
YES. I can't hardly wait for the Vice Presidential debates! #current
I love the fact that Lehrer was able to tell the candidates to stay on topic. #current
mccain won in having an eye burning tie #current
Well, considering it was the foreign policy debate, I'd give the slight edge to McCain on this one. But VERY slight. #debate08 #current
#current Obama won.
#current i have to say mccain did really well.  bummed.  thing is, its clear that Obama is WAY smarter.
YAY! #Current Drink drink drink!!!
@BarackObama Good Job. #current!
that was RAD.  Nice job Current TV, nice job Twitter... nice job pundits!  #current #debate08
Awesome First Debate! #tweetdebate   Good job Obama!  The US should be the first nation to have 2 presidents at the same time
McCain won tonights debate but Obama was alright. Obama should have done better tonight though especially early with the economy #current
I'm very much looking forward to Obama's inauguration. It will be a great day for America. We've been through a long, dark tunnel. #current
Thanks you guys, everyone rocked. Join us next time for the VP debates on Oct. 2nd #current
Thay came in with game tonight #current
Yay! for non-dibating stuff :) #current
#tweetdebate Correction: The iPhone and Twitterriffic rock!!
Hmmmm, pretty uneventful debate.  No clear winner/loser.  Both sharp.  BTW, I like listening to David Brooks from NYT on PBS #current
the verdict: an interesting first debate, but no conclusive winner as yet. #current
#current And we're off... Not sure about the 'winner'. Guess overall Obama was better. McCain really grew in this debate.
Seems like Obama was fighting out of the corner tonight. Stayed on defense.  He came off rude and dodgy.  McCain wins by TKO. #current
Did either of the candidates discuss border control issues? That is a key consideration for the economy and national security.  #current
LMAO @ the moderators correcting mccain's factual inaccuracies in the debate...  #tweetdebate #current
So, who do you think is best to handle the Presidency? Is there any doubt? McCain #current #debate08

McCain likes to name drop, declare that he knows everyone, and tell stories. Yawn. #current
OK so which campaign is going to scream the loudest that they won?  And how can we cut through the spin? #debate08 #current
#current Watching the folk on Twitter say how *clearly* the candidate they like best won the debate. :D
#debate: obama gana puntos en economÃ­a, rusia. Pero en el aspecto de seguridad, ambos candidatos ignoraron a AmÃ©rica Latina #current
I didn't really hear anything new in this debate. Hope future debates won't sound like political news pundit speak, too. #current #debate08
#tweetdebate: McCain says he'll take care of veterans. Just not if it includes a GI Bill. McCain knows how to heal wounds of war? Not quite.
#current I am worried on the whole with both of our choices
#tweetdebate Mccain lost he sucks hope he does not become President
@MediaLizzy mccain also knows how to create wounds of war by advocating so much war and deploying troops unnecessarily #debate #current
You know McCain should just stand there and sing "Mr. Self Destruct" by NIN. #current
#current and now the anchors and pundits tell us what we should think
John, you voted against the Webb bill to pay for college education for veterans. #current
.i am on my knees praying for a stray bullet in johnnys direction...but no brave souls seem apt on playing g-d this evening. #current
The number one problem is that there is too much emphasis on retarded communication tech instead of things that matter. #current
Obama wins!!! #tweetdebate
McCain clearly won this debate, Obama is lacking in the depth of knowledge it takes to lead and be the U.S. president  #current #debate08
Good debate, a little boring but glad to see it anyway. #current
see you guys back here next week #current
@jowyang what was your tally? #tweetdebate
#current #debate08 the moderator really favored McCain...
#debate08 I'd say Obama led early on economic stuff, and finished strong, but McCain's strong middle gives him a slight win.
@JustinGunn GOod job to you and yours. That was the most debating I've done with people on politics since I lived in DC.

Hack the debate with twitter was pretty intersting. Has my vote. #current
Obama looked more presidential +2 #tweetdebate
#debate08 The first debate can be summed up very easily "Senator McCain is right!"
I rock with Obama. #current
The most dangerous man in America, David Brooks, and Mark Shields are saying that the debate changed nobody's mind. True, I think. #current
#current Close call.  Too close to call?
Obama won on the economy. Tied on foreign policy issues. #debate08
#debate08 obama might have held his own, but mccain is a foreign policy dude. who knows who won.
#debate08 Mmmmm I think about it as a 50/50 .... not bad, waiting for the polls of tuesday!
@Marti_L I think both of them were uneven. Obama did OK, McCain swung from old grumpy/snipey to bland. #debate08

Glad to hear CNN is fact checking the presidential candidates' comments. Will be interesting to see what they find. #current
Obama did a good job of relating the issues together instead of just focusing on one thing at a time #debate08
#current not sure who 'won' but Obama obviously came off as the more personable of the two. Still voting Obama :)
All in all- good debate! Candidates were fairly intelligent and mostly respectful. Didn't change my opinion, but glad I watched. #current
The real winner tonight was Jim Lehrer.  You can't say PBS people don't have balls. #debate08
Based on this, either candidate should be good. Impressed by both candidates. #debate08
Retweeting @mamikaze: @Krississippi being from a military family, I do not trust Mccain's itchy trigger finger on bit. #debate08

#debate08 People are saying Lehrer favored McCain... I thought he was supposed to be all liberal biased?
wow chris matthews says obama looked more presidential but might have given up too many points. #current #tweetdebate
#debate08 Overall impression: McCain consistently set the tone and subject of the debate topics, Obama was following and playing defense...
#debate08 Mostly a draw, don't think it swayed many people.
Good point King, this debate didn't say anything new to people who have been closely looking, but did talk to less informed people. #current
#current I thought Obama would do much better. I think he pulled his punches.
@lukemcneur Disagree mate. Obama was calm cool, and direct. McCain was floundering  #debate08
#debate08 Nice call from @dbrauer. Obama did hold his own. I guess maybe he gets the nod for a victory. Bar too low though. For Palin too

#current can we remove 10,000 votes from McCain/Palin every time one of them utters "maverick"?
#debate08 I'm hoping the spin coverage points out how condescending McCain was towards Obama, that was frustrating.
wow, Biden is talking but they won't let Palin? Why not? Sexist?? #tweetdebate

#debate08 one thing we can agree on is these guys beat Bush & Kerry in a tag team any day.
I enjoyed that debate. thought it was smartly and hotly battled. personally it solidified my support for obama. #Debate08
Still voting Obama #current
@BarackObama You did AWESOME!!!!!!!!!
But overall - McCain was GREAT - very impressed, maybe I had low expectations but great lines & responses #debate08 #current
It was an exciting debate, but I expected more blood. #current
McCain certainly looked better than expected, but with all the lies, I'm not calling it a win. Obama should have been less polite. #debate08
#debate08 I'm surprisingly sober.They must have totally trained the primary buzz words out of their systems.  No change this time my friends
given the debate topic McCain should have won, but i think Obama really caught up...maybe even surpassed the old guy #current
As much as I don't like Obama, he didn't do poorly. When you're in the lead, that's good. #debate08
#debate08 Felt like Obama was very strong in the beginning, but overall didn't have as many taglines as McCain that people will fawn over
#current there is no way we can pull out of Iraq, just ask the troops, do a poll on that
#debate08 I don't think anything was said tonight to move the election.
@usermac Truth be told, I'd be happy to have McCain or Obama as President. I just dont think we can afford 4 Republican years. #current
From the persoanl attacks from left on #current and #debate08 it is obvious McCain scored points over Obama
@kathrynjones he was raised in a time when racism was ok i love the old ppl in my family but they are racists 2 - its ingrained in that gen!
@Condoulo and how isn't he respecting the country?
Next time I' ll twitter on #current and #tweetdebate AND invite friends over for a drinking game

McCain needed to look more independent.  Now he looks to ride Obama's coattails with the "I agree" commercial.  #debate08 #mccain #obama
#debate08 Why is Obama agreeing with John McCain on obvious issues a bad thing?
#current Mantra from McCain spin room: this was a debate on "McCain's turf." Next up: Biden's take on it.
#current Wow. You can see the republicans on this page just by looking for old white guy avatars.
Man, McCain's already got a post-debate ad up, http://tinyurl.com/43n74w #debate08
Obama just let McCain back into the race by not going for the jugular during that debate. #debate08
I hate watching presidential debates.  They just get me all anxious and freaked out!  Obama needs a better rhetorical strategy.  #debate08
#current Biden: who was right and who was wrong? John has been "dead wrong" about [everything]. John was wrong about strategy & tactics.
What's that used car salesman doing on CNN? Oh, it's Joe Biden. #debate08 #current
@fakejohnmccain John John John, I won't be respectful and call you "Senator McCain" even if you do #tweetdebate

#debate08 Why does every veteran I know support Obama over McCain?
#debate08 @siskita brings up a good point--where is Palin tonight? Biden is apparently on TV...
Okay: So we saw the debate on CSPAN2, where there was no split-screen. Could it be that the split-screen made Obama appear to win?  #current

#current - The only thing Obama doesn't understand, grampy gramps (my age) McCain, is the necessity of thinking like McCain.
#debate08 GOP pundits: "McCain! McCain! McCain!!!". Democrat pundits: "Obama! Obama! Obama!!!". Haaaa...  spin...  how useless...
Don't worry fellas.  You'll get work in four years when some other GOP schlep runs against Obama.  #debate08 #mccain #obama
#current Biden: "John doesn't even know the difference between strategy & tactics and he's lecturing Obama on it." Ha, ha...
#current Biden: John was on his strongest turf today and he lost. I think it's fatal. I hope Palin defends same position than McCain did.
@infinitelymeta i was watching twitter's election2008 pg too - enjoyed following the #tweetdebate thread - quite entertaining...

And for all of you tweeters twittering over McCain's "Existential Threat" that was no error; literally: "A threat to existence" #current
#debate08 1st debate done & i still don't think i'm leaning either way. finger pointing & 1/2 truths on both sides. not much honesty imho
@janoss - Obama =total control over emotive... typical Lyndon Johnson "socialist." At the same time- I wonder how he won over "experience."

on the even, it was a draw. but for an overall subject that is supposed to be in mccain's pocket, he did pretty poorly. #debate08
McCain jokes about Bear DNA funding but Palin requested funds to study Harbor Seals WTF? #current #tweetdebate
If McCain vetoes every bit of pork, he'll be vetoing money for road and bridge construction, among other things. #debate08

@UltraNurd talk about a self-selected sample. his readers don't exactly come from both sides. #debate08
@davidweiner McCain did not have a temper flare, at least when compared to Americans of southern Italian extraction.
#debate08 GOP supporters need to start recognizing that independents aren't falling for the same 2004 tricks.

As a Hillary Clinton fanatic, I thought maybe I wasn't properly listening to the primary debates. I was. Barack was again weak. #debate08

fox is showing undecided voters and asking them who moved them. -- 65/35 split for Obama - ouch. #debate08
I think that Keating5 is a dangerous topic, better suited for ads than a debate #debate08
They say Obama's professorial, but I've never heard so much revisionist >1950s American history as I did tonight from Doc McCain. #debate08
#debate08 The fact that they call it the "Spin room" should be enough reason to avoid listening to it at all costs.
@emilychang If Repubs dig up Nixon's moldy skeleton, vote to impeach, & put the remains in jail cell for 20 yrs, I'll consider it. #debate08
#debate08 What McCain doesn't understand is saying "What Omaba doesn't understand is ..." becomes a counterproductive insult after 20 times.
My day job is simplifying messages. I was cringing throughout. Barack talked too much. And was too esoteric. #debate08
All McCain has is lies why can't he just tell the American people the truth. #current
#current Anderson to Wolf "don't hold your breath waiting for Palin to comment tonight" (laughter all around)
#debate08 my feelings are pretty much this... why JUST those two canidates? I thought there were more than two???
@cyn3matic McCain's tie looks fine in HD, but I hear it was aliasing like crazy on SD channels. #debate08
@Imarilove Yes!!! Obama has done more for veterans than McCain has DESPITE the fact that McCain's a former POW.
@Imarilove hehehe but I can't drive now, I've already started on my wine...
so how many hours/days do you think it'll take the media to spin the debate in favor of obama and conclude he won? #debate08

McCain's solution to diplomacy is to not talk to the parties involved and have a New World Order that bosses the world. Brilliant. #current
@stevenbjohnson he said "don't torture... ever again." pretty clearly. #debate08
@janoss - re: emotive - neither candidate has it, but I met Obama in Chicago...so I'm biased. Obama likes to meet eye-to-eye.
#debate08 biden/palin debate viewship will trump this one. Great odds biden gaffes like never before, or palin completely melts down
@etherkiller and when Obama tried to set his own record straight, McCain talked over him. Obama was the better man and stood down. #debate08

#debate08 This debate had nothing on my debate with Miss Royal. Now that was theater ! I have big hopes for Biden vsPalin though on tues.

#2019 #current going through the commentary during the debates, it seems the public has as much of a grasp as the candidates.
#debate08 McCain: "we send $700B to countries that don't like us." Fed Govt only sends $39B in foreign aid, his # is what we spend on oil.
#debate08 McCain's temper and disrespect fit nicely with the new image of the US that the Bush administration has built up for the world.
@Imarilove Practice? He's had how many years in Washington to practice??
@AFashionista, really? Did he not mention that he's a war hero yet again? How's that good? #debate08

@janoss - So, IMO, Obama won in his eye-to-eye, direct points, and his mission. The differences were very clear tonight.
#current  Why the obsessions on both right and left with who won? Both candidates clarified their positions--the viewers were the winners.
@cristalbubblin did you not see the same LIVE show? are you still living at the radio station ? :(

#debate08... MSNBC says McCain. Fox News says Obama. What the hell?

too funny, people think Obama won the #debate08 As if they polled all American Joe Doakes! Obama drones on like Couric. Boring ppl to sleep!
#debate08 FOX keeps repeating the parts where Obama said McCain is right. go figure.
9/15 post about Kissinger's stance on talking wih Iran: http://tinyurl.com/5pabty You can't come out and lie about it now, Henry! #current
@stoutware McCain doesn't know the difference between Sunni and Shia, or where Spain is. #debate08
#debate08 mccain fed in so many lies, misleading statements and other dreck it would be impossible to refute them all!
#debate08 Great coverage on CNN measuring audience responses in real-time.
#2019 #current looking back on it now, I can't say that it made much of a difference to us now, unless the other guy cut GEAS funding.
Who do you think won the debate? http://tinyurl.com/4tajbx  #tweetdebate  #current
@mkantonelli I love writing ;/ but after work my hands  ache
#current #debate08  apparently the GOP is makin an ad showing Obama saying "John's right".  Won't that simply show that Obama is bipartisan?
@Imarilove i think they had to dose him with whatever they've been dosing Bush with for 8 years and didn't get enough tranquilizer in. (jk)
@korym It's like freakin' 4chan with all the nonsense, hah.
#current Ha! emailers to CNN accusing network of letting Biden come on and NOT Palin. Stupid uniformed people might still win it for McCain!
#debate08 Where is Palin hiding? Has she declined all post-debate interviews?
@macartisan joking actually because I didnt see any McCain supporters tweeting
RT @kcrusher #debate08 mccain fed in so many lies, misleading statements and other dreck it would be impossible to refute them all!
Biden on MSNBC: "A good night for our team." #debate08
McCain was silent while Obama talked.  Obama kept on trying to get a word in during McCain's answers.  That bothered me a lot. #debate08
#debate08 the CW (Halperin) says Obama A- McCain B-, sounds about right http://tinyurl.com/4q7f8d
@macartisan i was being sarcastic
Henry Kissinger just issued a statement that he does in fact agree with McCain on the talking with foreign leaders bit #current #debate08
@problogger debate caused slowness check out #current it was a current.tv and twitted and laughingsquid experiment ( and others)
Joe Biden on MSNBC live now. #current
@msblog yay, new friend. :) hi.
People called into CNN to ask why they interviewed Biden and not Palin. Wolf Blitzer says they coudn't get that interview. LOL. #debate08
RUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUDY!!!!!!!!! #debate08 #current
#debate08 I'm looking forward to the factcheck.org summary tomorrow.
Both candidates are WRONG on Russia and Georgia. #debate08
#debate08 @LipstickVP I disagree, McCain's voice puts me to sleep with his monotone lisp
@LipstickVP I almost put myself to sleep during the #debate08 - I'm so much better with a teleprompter!
@Imarilove escrow did that to me too. it's the whole paper length thing that gets to me. I have a problem with being terse and not wordy.
@mkantonelli he wouldn't look Obama in the eyes at all maybe he thought he would get hexed ;/
Really, why couldn't McCain look Obama in the eye?  Callow, lying, honorless jackass.  #current
#debate08 @Autumm right, only his statement was rebutted by his own clip of agreeing with Obama
@etherkiller i don't know, i'm a huge probama, but i think mccain did well, i wanted obama to do better
@DanaBelfry His riches are from his wife's BEER wealth. Even during a depression (especially!), people would still buy beer. #debate08
RT @orbitaldiamonds   #debate08 CNN just played the clip of Kissinger favoring high-level talks with Iran without preconditions. #mccain
@Autumm too bad for ol' kissy, CNN was already playing video of him being in favor of them. #debate08
#current Obama: a bit dull and professorial. McCain condescending and bitter.
Stupid people will be voting for Obama, want govt. handouts. #current
#debate08 - man Biden is GOOD (MSNBC).
@korym Good night!
Obama: McCain you're right.  McCain: Senator Obama just doesn't understand #current #debate08
@domesticvanilla i was thinking the same thing....the panel of watchers on fox seemed evenly split too #debate08
@dksnyder you missed the bit where McCain talked over Obama when Obama tried to state his own record. Confirmation bias. #debate08
@dksnyder Because McCain kept telling lies!! It's hard to stay silent when someone lies. #debate08
Hmm...BO may have slighted his elder by calling him by his first name. #debate08
#current - Wow!  Obama does his homework!  The most impressive thing tonight - HE HAD HIS OWN BRACELET!  So there!  Let the droolfest begin!
@Imarilove I don't trust someone who won't meet my gaze.  I liked the fact that Obama looked directly at the camera(toward people watching)
#debate08 It scares me that people being polled still think McCain is better on military/veteran issues. Support the troops -- vote Obama!
@tarheelcoxn but that started off as McCain's question to answer and B.O. started in...
@etherkiller Good point. Part of the post-debate spin alley is seeing what all sides are saying happened, though.
@VizionQuest RT: Obama: McCain you're right. McCain: Senator Obama just doesn't understand #current #debate08
: #debate08 Truth is, I wanted Obama to do better.
*GASP*!! McCain doesn't have on a flag pin! He doesn't love America! #debate08
@claymaker They're BOTH full of it!  Lies, and covering their tracks.  I was just bothered by the constant interjections! #debate08
you have to be a fast reader at http://election.twitter.com/ #debate08
#debate08, Obama will let anyone talk over top of him. Not very macho. McCain will kick ass & talk over top of all peoples/nations RNCFTW
Results are in. I won the #debate08.
#debate08 mccain wants nuclear, obama wants renewables - which has the better future?
And what does #current mean?
#current #debate McCain has been totally against all vet efforts, and has a very low rating w/ vet groups. Why didn't Obama point that out?
McCain wasn't wearing a flag pin on his lapel. I look forward to the right-wing outcry. #debate08
Guessing that Sarah Palin's being given scripted speaking points before commenting on the debate tonight. #current #debate08
@orbitaldiamonds  #debate08 even the veterans don't support mccain!
hey guys, Hack the Debate round II will be happening October 2nd. here's the promo: http://current.com/items/89344327_ #current
#debate08 Biden is on fire on MSNBC. Really nailing it.
#debate08 interesting debate, I thought Obama held his own pretty well for what was considered McCains home turf
#debate08 wtf is this McCain twitter banner next to barack's banner? http://twitter.com/JohnMcCain. Fake JM?!?
#debate08 Who won? It depends on the topic. McCain good on foreign policy. Obama on home turf/leadership. Looking for fact checks.
@shannon_e We are! community.livejournal.com/biden_daily #debate08
@newshour has hashtagged the debate  #debate08.  Same tag for VPs?
When McCain called for a freeze on gov't spending, I thought of Nixon's wage and price controls. Didn't work http://poprl.com/1LN #debate08
@MercuryMetro they have to program her. #debate08
@sarking It's called projecting. McCain is accusing Obama of McCain's own faults. #debate08
HUGE thanks to the @twitter team for partnering on this. we can't wait to do it again next week. #current
#debate08 @kcrusher Nuclear all the way. We need to explore that territory more.
Obama did very well  #debate08
Biden is the MAN! #debate08
Collected my thoughts and I think mcain would do some stuff well. But Obama would do more, better. #current night
@freeulysses use the #debate08 or it wont get on there friend
#debate08  If McCain is Grandpa Simpson, then Obama is...
I love how McCain is claiming he's bipartisan but then uses his opponent agreeing with him as a cudgel in an ad. Hypocrisy? #debate08
#debate08 remember - mccain wanted to vote against the GI bill until it was political suicide to do so.
at 11:25, I've officially hit debate analysis overload...what else is on? #debate08
I think McCain won this debate easily #current
Joe Biden just dropped a brute steamer on McCain's face on MSNBC #debate08
#debate08 http://www.drudgereport.com/ poll: McCain wins 70-27
#debate08 Why are people saying that I looked like a little college student in a debate class???
#debate08 That CNN excit-o-meter at the bottom of the screen distracted me. People like name-dropping, do not like negativity.
#debate08 - Biden's good - mccain needs to start figuring out a reason #suspend the veep debate.
@shayera No kidding! I want to see her be interviewed by Anderson Cooper or Campbell Brown or Keith Olbermann or Rachel Maddow! #debate08
#debate08 FOX says McCain won the debate. MSNBC points out McCain gaffes. CNN more balanced. Maddow/Olbermann more intelligent commentary.
#debate08 did your favorite candidate "beat" the other guy? Of course he did, you preconceived it. CNN's meter cracked me up.

#debate08 #current pickens plan ad on msnbc. don't fall for the water grab plan. he's still an oil man at heart.
@Imarilove Yes, He did. I liked the eye contact. #debate08 #tweetdebate
Bloggers right; mccain won because it is his issue. #debate08
Face to Face with George Hussein Obama, Barack Obamaâ€™s brother http://tinyurl.com/4ckd5j <-- was this brought up in #debate08 ?
@RobertBluey Well, then McCain needs to prove that he's head and shoulders above Obama on policy - Are you saying BO rope-a-doped?
y say its ok to 'tie' bc its the other guy's strength? foreign policy is NOT mccain's strength. why do we keep giving them ground? #debate08
Future debate advice for Obama: 1) Fewer words 2) Don't debate details 3) Make McCain laugh 4) More stories  #debate08
@michaelszeto I disagree totally.
@cnn #tweetdebate - Anyone else find it rude that McCain didn't even look at Obama once?
Both candidates are unable to tell the difference between the Republican Guard and the Revolutionary Guard. #debate08
#debate08 Lehrer pounding on 'What can't we do, due to cost of bailout?' = job interview "What would you do if bear broke into yr house?"
CNN poll on the debate...McCain got ObamOWNED. #debate08
Anyone trying to say John McCain is a liar, suffers misanthropy. John McCain likes anyone that likes him first. It's how he rolls! #debate08
CNN post debate polling is saying the debate went to Obama with over a 10 point lead #debate08 #current
@RobTornoe Lisa, of course.  #debate08
@DominickEvans Thanks!
#momocrats #current seriously, as a woman, you should consider hosting a letter-writing party if you can prior to election sign-up closure
Both candidates are unable to tell the difference between the Republican Guard and the Revolutionary Guard. #debate08
Very big Obama lead in the CNN post debate poll. Interesting. #debate08
CNN:  Obama won debate 51-38%.  Also had him win on Iraq and the Economy. #tweetdebate
